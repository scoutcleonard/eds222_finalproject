This repository contains the contents of my final project for EDS 222. The project explores the seasonality of the USDA's National School Lunch Program(NSLP) and and the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on how NSLP serves students using monthly national data from the USDA with coverage from October 2017 to August 2021. 

The repository contains:
